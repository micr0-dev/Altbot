## About

Altbot is an open-source accessibility bot designed to enhance the Fediverse by generating alt-text descriptions for images, video, and audio. This helps make content more accessible to users with visual impairments.

## Privacy & GDPR Compliance

**Altbot 2.0 now processes everything 100% locally with zero data retention!** [![Mastodon Follow](https://img.shields.io/mastodon/follow/113183205946060973?domain=fuzzies.wtf&style=social)](https://fuzzies.wtf/@altbot)

In compliance with GDPR, Altbot requires explicit informed consent before processing any user requests. When you interact with Altbot for the first time, you'll receive a consent request with information about data collection practices and a link to our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

- **What we collect:** Request timestamps, processing times, language preferences, media type
- **What we don't collect:** Images, personal information, content of your posts
- **How to revoke consent:** Simply block the bot account

Your post content is never saved or shared. Only images without existing alt-text will be processed, and all processing happens privately on our local server.

## Disclaimer

Alt-texts are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM). While we strive for accuracy, results may sometimes be factually incorrect. Always double-check the alt-text before using it.

## How It Works

Altbot listens for mentions and follows on Mastodon. When it detects a mention or a new post from a followed user, it checks for images without alt-text. If it finds any, it uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate descriptive alt-text and replies with the generated text.

### Features

- **Mention-Based Alt-Text Generation:** Mention @Altbot in a reply to any post containing an image, video, or audio, and Altbot will generate an alt-text description for it.
- **Automatic Alt-Text for Followers:** Follow @Altbot, and it will monitor your posts. If you post an image, video, or audio without alt-text, Altbot will automatically generate one for you.
- **Local LLM Support:** Use local LLMs via Ollama for generating alt-text descriptions.
- **Dual-Model Translation:** Optionally use a separate, smaller model for translation (e.g., use a large vision model for alt-text and a fast text model for translation).
- **GDPR Compliance:** Explicit informed consent system that requires users to provide consent before processing their requests, with clear information about data usage.
- **Consent Requests:** Ask for consent from the original poster before generating alt-text when mentioned by non-OP users.
- **Configurable Settings:** Easily configure the bot using a TOML file.

## Setup

### Standard

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/micr0-dev/Altbot.git
   cd Altbot
   ```

2. Run the setup wizard:

   ```sh
   go run .
   ```

   The setup wizard will guide you through configuring the essential values required for the bot, including:

   - Your Mastodon server URL, client secret, access token, and bot username.
   - The admin contact handle for moderation notifications.
   - Enabling optional features like metrics and alt-text reminders.

   Alternatively, copy the example configuration file and edit it manually:

   ```sh
   cp example.config.toml config.toml
   ```

3. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   go run .
   ```

### Docker

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/micr0-dev/Altbot.git
   cd Altbot
   ```

2. Run the setup wizard:

   ```sh
   docker run -it -v ./:/data --rm ghcr.io/micr0-dev/altbot:latest
   ```

   The setup wizard will guide you through configuring the essential values required for the bot, including:

   - Your Mastodon server URL, client secret, access token, and bot username.
   - The admin contact handle for moderation notifications.
   - Enabling optional features like metrics and alt-text reminders.

   Alternatively, copy the example configuration file and edit it manually:

   ```sh
   cp example.config.toml config.toml
   ```

3. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24+**: Install from [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl/)
- **LLM Provider** (one of the following):
  - **Gemini API**: Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
  - **Ollama**: Install from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/) and pull a vision model (e.g., `ollama pull llava-phi3`)
  - **Transformers**: Requires Python with transformers library and a compatible GPU
- **Mastodon Account**: Create a bot account on a Mastodon instance and generate API credentials

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/micr0-dev/Altbot.git
   cd Altbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   go mod download
   ```

3. Copy and configure the config file:
   ```sh
   cp example.config.toml config.toml
   # Edit config.toml with your credentials
   ```

4. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   go run .
   ```

### Development Mode

Use the `--dev` flag to run the bot in development mode. This provides an interactive command-line interface for testing without posting to Mastodon:

```sh
go run . --dev
```

**Note:** Dev mode skips Mastodon authentication, but you still need a valid LLM API key (Gemini, Ollama, etc.) configured in `config.toml` to test image/video/audio processing.

#### Dev Mode Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/image <url>` | Process an image URL and generate alt-text |
| `/video <url>` | Process a video URL and generate alt-text |
| `/audio <url>` | Process an audio URL and generate alt-text |
| `/lang [code]` | Set/show language for responses (e.g., en, de, ja) |
| `/follow` | Simulate a follow event |
| `/status` | Show current dev mode status |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/quit` | Exit dev mode |

You can also paste a URL directly to process it as an image.

**Example session:**
```
[dev] > /lang de
Language set to: de

[dev] > https://example.com/image.jpg
Processing image: https://example.com/image.jpg
Please wait...
