# Altbot Trademark Policy

_Version 1.0 - Effective March 14, 2025_

## Overview

The name "Altbot" and the Altbot logo are unregistered trademarks of Micr0Byte (micr0@micr0.dev). This policy outlines acceptable uses of the Altbot name and brand.

Note: This trademark policy is separate from the AGPLv3 license that governs the Altbot code. The code remains open source, while this policy protects the Altbot brand identity.

## Acceptable Uses

- Referring to the original Altbot project (https://github.com/micr0-dev/Altbot)
- Stating that your project is "Based on Altbot" or "Powered by Altbot"
- Mentioning Altbot when discussing compatibility or integration
- Fair use references in articles, tutorials, or documentation

## Unacceptable Uses

- Naming your instance, fork, or derivative work "Altbot" (with or without modifications like "Altbot+", "New Altbot", etc.)
- Using the Altbot name in a way that suggests your project is official or endorsed by the original Altbot team
- Using the Altbot logo as your project's primary identifier
- Using the Altbot name in a way that may confuse users about the source of the software

## Forks and Derivative Works

If you create a fork or derivative work based on Altbot:

- You must use a different primary name for your project
- You may state "Based on Altbot" or "Powered by Altbot technology" in your documentation
- You should include a link to the original Altbot project

## Altbot Logo and Character Definition

The Altbot brand includes the following distinctive elements:

1. **The Altbot Logo**: A stylized design featuring a small purple robot icon, often displayed against a light background. This logo appears in the project banner and various promotional materials.

2. **The Altbot Character**: A distinctive mascot character with a robot-like body and a magnifying glass in place of a head. This character symbolizes the bot's function of examining and describing visual content to improve accessibility.

These visual elements are protected as part of the Altbot brand identity. Any use of these visual elements must comply with this trademark policy. The acceptable and unacceptable uses outlined above apply equally to both the Altbot name and these visual brand elements.

Specifically:

- You may not use the Altbot logo or character as the primary identifier for your fork or derivative work
- You may use small versions of these elements when specifically referring to compatibility with or derivation from the original Altbot project, provided you clearly indicate your project is "Based on Altbot" rather than being Altbot itself
- Any use of these visual elements must be accompanied by appropriate attribution to the original Altbot project
